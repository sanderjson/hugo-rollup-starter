# Top Common Bash Linux Commands for Beginners


## What is Bash?

Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script. Like all Unix shells, it supports filename globbing (wildcard matching), piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration.

## Commands

### change directory up

```bash

    $ cd ..

```

### change directory to folder

```bash

    $ cd myFolder
    # or
    $ cd path/to/myFolder

```

### list files
```bash

    ls

```

### delete a file (remove)
```bash

    $ rm myFile

```

### delete a folder (remove)
```bash

    $ rm -rf myFolder

```

### rename folder
```bash

    $ mc oldName newName

```
